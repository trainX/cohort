# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to build an API that can be used by an autonomous vehicle scheduling system to figure out the optimal time for a person to visit a destination.  This destination can be a shoping mall, department of motor vehicles, grocery store, etc. This API will allow an autonmous vehicle to optimize utilization by recommending a certain schedule based on a number of datasets.
